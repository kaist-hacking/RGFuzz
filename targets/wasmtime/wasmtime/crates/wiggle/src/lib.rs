/// A trait which abstracts how to get at the region of host memory that
/// contains guest memory.
///
/// All `GuestPtr` types will contain a handle to this trait, signifying where
/// the pointer is actually pointing into. This type will need to be implemented
/// for the host's memory storage object.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Safety around this type is tricky, and the trait is `unsafe` since there are
/// a few contracts you need to uphold to implement this type correctly and have
/// everything else in this crate work out safely.
///
/// The most important method of this trait is the `base` method. This returns,
/// in host memory, a pointer and a length. The pointer should point to valid
/// memory for the guest to read/write for the length contiguous bytes
/// afterwards.
///
/// The region returned by `base` must not only be valid, however, but it must
/// be valid for "a period of time before the guest is reentered". This isn't
/// exactly well defined but the general idea is that `GuestMemory` is allowed
/// to change under our feet to accommodate instructions like `memory.grow` or
/// other guest modifications. Memory, however, cannot be changed if the guest
/// is not reentered or if no explicitly action is taken to modify the guest
/// memory.
///
/// This provides the guarantee that host pointers based on the return value of
/// `base` have a dynamic period for which they are valid. This time duration
/// must be "somehow nonzero in length" to allow users of `GuestMemory` and
/// `GuestPtr` to safely read and write interior data.
///
/// This type also provides methods for run-time borrow checking of references
/// into the memory. The safety of this mechanism depends on there being exactly
/// one associated tracking of borrows for a given WebAssembly memory. There
/// must be no other reads or writes of WebAssembly the memory by either Rust or
/// WebAssembly code while there are any outstanding borrows, as given by
/// `GuestMemory::has_outstanding_borrows()`.
///
/// # Using References
///
/// The [`GuestPtr::as_slice`] or [`GuestPtr::as_str`] will return smart
/// pointers [`GuestSlice`] and [`GuestStr`]. These types, which implement
/// [`std::ops::Deref`] and [`std::ops::DerefMut`], provide mutable references
/// into the memory region given by a `GuestMemory`.
///
/// These smart pointers are dynamically borrow-checked by the borrow checker
/// methods on this trait. While a `GuestSlice` or a `GuestStr` are live, the
/// [`GuestMemory::has_outstanding_borrows()`] method will always return `true`.
/// If you need to re-enter the guest or otherwise read or write to the contents
/// of a WebAssembly memory, all `GuestSlice`s and `GuestStr`s for the memory
/// must be dropped, at which point `GuestMemory::has_outstanding_borrows()`
/// will return `false`.

/// A *guest* pointer into host memory.
///
/// This type represents a pointer from the guest that points into host memory.
/// Internally a `GuestPtr` contains a handle to its original [`GuestMemory`] as
/// well as the offset into the memory that the pointer is pointing at.
///
/// Presence of a [`GuestPtr`] does not imply any form of validity. Pointers can
/// be out-of-bounds, misaligned, etc. It is safe to construct a `GuestPtr` with
/// any offset at any time. Consider a `GuestPtr<T>` roughly equivalent to `*mut
/// T`, although there are a few more safety guarantees around this type.
///
/// ## Slices and Strings
///
/// Note that the type parameter does not need to implement the `Sized` trait,
/// so you can implement types such as this:
///
/// * `GuestPtr<'_, str>` - a pointer to a guest string. Has the methods
///   [`GuestPtr::as_str_mut`], which gives a dynamically borrow-checked
///   `GuestStrMut<'_>`, which `DerefMut`s to a `&mut str`, and
///   [`GuestPtr::as_str`], which is the shareable version of same.
/// * `GuestPtr<'_, [T]>` - a pointer to a guest array. Has methods
///   [`GuestPtr::as_slice_mut`], which gives a dynamically borrow-checked
///   `GuestSliceMut<'_, T>`, which `DerefMut`s to a `&mut [T]` and
///   [`GuestPtr::as_slice`], which is the shareable version of same.
///
/// Unsized types such as this may have extra methods and won't have methods
/// like [`GuestPtr::read`] or [`GuestPtr::write`].
///
/// ## Type parameter and pointee
///
/// The `T` type parameter is largely intended for more static safety in Rust as
/// well as having a better handle on what we're pointing to. A `GuestPtr<T>`,
/// however, does not necessarily literally imply a guest pointer pointing to
/// type `T`. Instead the [`GuestType`] trait is a layer of abstraction where
/// `GuestPtr<T>` may actually be a pointer to `U` in guest memory, but you can
/// construct a `T` from a `U`.
///
/// For example `GuestPtr<GuestPtr<T>>` is a valid type, but this is actually
/// more equivalent to `GuestPtr<u32>` because guest pointers are always
/// 32-bits. That being said you can create a `GuestPtr<T>` from a `u32`.
///
/// Additionally `GuestPtr<MyEnum>` will actually delegate, typically, to and
/// implementation which loads the underlying data as `GuestPtr<u8>` (or
/// similar) and then the bytes loaded are validated to fit within the
/// definition of `MyEnum` before `MyEnum` is returned.
///
/// For more information see the [`GuestPtr::read`] and [`GuestPtr::write`]
/// methods. In general though be extremely careful about writing `unsafe` code
/// when working with a `GuestPtr` if you're not using one of the
/// already-attached helper methods.
