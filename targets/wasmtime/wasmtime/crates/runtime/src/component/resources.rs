//! Implementation of the canonical-ABI related intrinsics for resources in the
//! component model.
//!
//! This module contains all the relevant gory details of the details of the
//! component model related to lifting and lowering resources. For example
//! intrinsics like `resource.new` will bottom out in calling this file, and
//! this is where resource tables are actually defined and modified.
//!
//! The main types in this file are:
//!
//! * `ResourceTables` - the "here's everything" context which is required to
//!   perform canonical ABI operations.
//!
//! * `ResourceTable` - an individual instance of a table of resources,
//!   basically "just a slab" though.
//!
//! * `CallContexts` - store-local information about active calls and borrows
//!   and runtime state tracking that to ensure that everything is handled
//!   correctly.
//!
//! Individual operations are exposed through methods on `ResourceTables` for
//! lifting/lowering/etc. This does mean though that some other fiddly bits
//! about ABI details can be found in lifting/lowering thoughout Wasmtime,
//! namely in the `Resource<T>` and `ResourceAny` types.

/// * During lifting and lowering both `tables` and `host_table` are `Some`.
/// * During wasm's own intrinsics only `tables` is `Some`.
/// * During embedder-invoked resource destruction calls only `host_table` is
